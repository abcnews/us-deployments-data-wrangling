"Resolution,” a report stating that at “approximately 3:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, on March 19, "
"2011,” he had directed U.S. military forces to commence “operations to assist an international effort "
authorized by the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council and undertaken with the support of 
"European allies and Arab partners, to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and address the threat "
posed to international peace and security by the crisis in Libya.” He further stated that U.S. military 
"forces, “under the command of Commander, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) began a series of "
strikes against air defense systems and military airfields for the purposes of preparing a no-fly zone.” 
These actions were part of “the multilateral response authorized under U.N. Security Council 
"Resolution 1973,” and the President added that “these strikes will be limited in their nature, duration, "
and scope. Their purpose is to support an international coalition as it takes all necessary measures to 
enforce the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. These limited U.S. actions will set the 
stage for further action by other coalition partners.” 
The President noted that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 authorized Member 
"States, under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and "
"civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya, including the establishment and enforcement "
of a “no-fly zone” in the airspace of Libya. United States military efforts are discrete and focused on 
employing unique U.S. military capabilities to set the conditions for our European allies and Arab 
partners to carry out the measures authorized by the U.N. Security Council Resolution. 
The President stated further that the “United States has not deployed ground forces into Libya. 
United States forces are conducting a limited and well-defined mission in support of international 
"efforts to protect civilians and prevent a humanitarian disaster.” Accordingly, he added, “U.S. forces "
"have targeted the Qadhafi regime’s air defense systems, command and control structures, and other "
capabilities of Qadhafi’s armed forces used to attack civilians and civilian populated areas.” It was the 
"intent of the United States, he said, to “seek a rapid, but responsible, transition of operations to "
"coalition, regional, or international organizations that are postured to continue activities as may be "
necessary to realize the objectives of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973.” The 
President said that the actions he had directed were “in the national security and foreign policy 
"interests of the United States.” He took them, the President stated, “pursuant to my constitutional "
authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.” 
"Central Africa. On October 14, 2011, the President submitted to Congress, “consistent with the War "
"Powers Resolution,” a report stating that “he had authorized a small number of combat-equipped "
U.S. forces to deploy to central Africa to provide assistance to regional forces that are working 
"toward the removal of Joseph Kony,” leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), from the "
"battlefield. For over two decades the LRA has murdered, kidnapped, and raped tens of thousands of "
"men, women, and children throughout central Africa, and has continued to commit atrocities in South "
"Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. The U.S. Armed "
"Forces, the President noted, would be a “significant contribution toward counter-LRA efforts in "
"central Africa.” The President stated that on “October 12, 2011, the initial team of U.S. military "
"personnel with appropriate combat equipment deployed to Uganda.” In the “next month, additional "
"forces will deploy, including a second combat-equipped team and associated headquarters, "
"communications, and logistics personnel.” The President further stated that the “total number of U.S. "
military personnel deploying for this mission is approximately 100. These forces will act as advisors to 
partner forces that have the goals of removing from the battlefield Joseph Kony and other senior 
"leadership of the LRA.” U.S. forces “will provide information, advice, and assistance to select partner "
"nation forces.” With the approval of the respective host nations, “elements of these U.S. forces will "
"deploy into Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the "
Congo. The support provided by U.S. forces will enhance regional efforts against the LRA.” The 
"President emphasized that even though the “U.S. forces are combat-equipped, they will only be "
"providing information, advice, and assistance to partner nation forces, and they will not themselves "
engage LRA forces unless necessary for self-defense. All appropriate precautions have been taken to 
ensure the safety of U.S. military personnel during their deployment.” The President took note in his 
"report that Congress had previously “expressed support for increased, comprehensive U.S. efforts to "
help mitigate and eliminate the threat posed by the LRA to civilians and regional stability” through the 
"passage of the Lord’s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009, "
"P.L. 111-172, enacted May 24, 2010. "
"Terrorism threat/Afghanistan/Libya/Iraq/Kosovo. On December 15, 2011, the President submitted to "
"Congress, “consistent with the War Powers Resolution,” a supplemental consolidated report, giving "
details of “deployments of U.S. Armed Forces equipped for combat.” The report detailed ongoing 
U.S. contingency operations overseas. The report noted that the total number of U.S. forces in 
"Afghanistan was “approximately 93,000,” of which approximately 78,000 are assigned to the "
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The United States continues to pursue 
and engage “remaining al-Qa’ida and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.” The United States has deployed 
"various “combat-equipped forces” to a number of locations in the Central, Pacific, European, "
"Southern, and African Command areas of operation in support of anti-terrorist and anti-al-Qa’ida "
actions. This includes the deployment of U.S. military forces globally: “including special operations and 
"other forces” for “sensitive operations” in various places, as well as forces to assist in enhancing the "
counterterrorism capabilities of our friends and allies. U.S. forces also have engaged in maritime 
"interception operations on the high seas “aimed at stopping the movement, arming and financing of "
certain international terrorist groups.” The United States continued to deploy military forces in Iraq 
to help it “maintain security and stability” there. These Iraqi operations were undertaken pursuant to 
"the terms of a bilateral agreement between the United States and Iraq, which entered into force on "
"January 1, 2009. The U.S. force level in Iraq on October 28, 2011, was “36,001 U.S. military "
"personnel.” The United States was committed to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq by December 31, "
"2011. (This occurred, as scheduled, after this report was submitted.) In Libya, after April 4, 2011, the "
"United States transferred responsibility for military operations there to NATO, and U.S. involvement "
“assumed a supporting role in the coalition’s efforts.” U.S. support in Libya was limited to 
"“intelligence, logistical support, and search and rescue assistance.” The U.S. military aircraft were also "
used to assist in the “suppression and destruction of air defenses in support of the no-fly zone” over 
"Libya. After April 23, 2011, the United States supported the coalition effort in Libya through use of "
“unmanned aerial vehicles against a limited set of clearly defined targets” there. Except in the case of 
"operations to “rescue the crew of a U.S. aircraft” on March 21, 2011, and deploying 16 U.S. military "
"personnel to aid in re-establishing the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli in September 2011, “the U.S. deployed "
"no ground forces to Libya.” On October 27, 2011, the United Nations terminated the “no-fly zone” "
"effective October 31, 2011. NATO terminated its mission during this same time. U.S. military "
"operations continue in Kosovo, as part of the NATO-led KFOR. Presently the United States "
contributes approximately 800 U.S. military personnel to KFOR.  
2012 ,"Somalia. On January 26, 2012, the President submitted to Congress, “consistent with the War Powers "
"","Resolution,” a report detailing a successful U.S. Special Operations Forces operation in Somalia of "
"","January 24, 2012, to rescue Ms. Jessica Buchanan, a U.S. citizen who had been kidnapped by a group "
"",linked to Somali pirates and financiers. This operation was undertaken “by a small number of joint 
"",combat-equipped U.S. forces” following receipt of reliable intelligence establishing her location in 
"","Somalia. A Danish national, Poul Hagen Thisted, kidnapped with Ms. Buchanan, was also rescued with "
"",her. 
"","Terrorism threat/Afghanistan/Somalia/Yemen/Central Africa/Kosovo. On June 15, 2012, the President "
"","reported to Congress “consistent with” the War Powers Resolution, a consolidated report regarding "
"",various deployments of U.S. Armed Forces equipped for combat. In the efforts in support of U.S. 
"","counterterrorism (CT) objectives against al-Qa’ida, the Taliban and, associated forces, he noted that "
"","U.S. forces engaged in Afghanistan in the above effort were “approximately 90,000.” With regard to "
"","other counter-terrorism operations, the President stated that the United States had deployed “U.S. "
"",combat-equipped forces to assist in enhancing the CT capabilities of our friends and allies including 
"",special operations and other forces for sensitive operations in various locations around the world.” 
"","He noted that the “U.S. military has taken direct action in Somalia against members of al-Qa’ida, "
"","including those who are also members of al-Shabaab, who are engaged in efforts to carry out "
"",terrorist attacks against the United States and our interests.” The President further stated that the 
"",U.S. military had been “working closely with the Yemeni government to operationally and ultimately 
"","eliminate the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa-ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the most active "
"",and dangerous affiliate of al-Qa’ida today.” He added that these “joint efforts have resulted in direct 
"",action against a limited number of AQAP operatives and senior leaders in that country who posed a 
"",terrorist threat to the United States and our interests.” The President noted that he would direct 
"","“additional measures against al-Qa’ida, the Taliban, and associated forces to protect U.S. citizens and "
"",interests.” Further information on such matters is provided in a “classified annex to this report.” 
"",Other military operations reported by the President include the “deployment of U.S. combat- 
"",equipped military personnel to Uganda to serve as advisors to regional forces that are working to 
"",apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and other senior Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) leaders from the 
"",battlefield and to protect local populations.” The total number of U.S. military personnel deployed for 
"","this mission is “approximately 90,” and elements of these U.S. forces have been sent to “forward "
"","locations in the LRA-affected areas of the Republic of South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the "
"","Congo, and the Central African Republic.” These U.S. forces “will not engage LRA forces except in "
"",self-defense.” The President also reported that presently the United States was contributing 
"",approximately 817 military personnel to the NATO-led KFOR in Kosovo. He also reported that the 
"",U.S. remained prepared to engage in “maritime interception operations” intended to stop the 
"","“movement, arming, and financing of certain international terrorist groups,” as well as stopping "
"",“proliferation by sea of weapons of mass destruction and related materials.” Additional details about 
"",these efforts are included in “the classified annex” to this report. 
"","Libya/Yemen. On September 14, 2012, the President reported to Congress, “consistent with” the War "
"","Powers Resolution, that on September 12, 2012, he ordered deployed to Libya “a security force from "
"",the U.S. Africa Command” to “support the security of U.S. personnel in Libya.” This action was taken 
"","in response to the attack on the U.S. “diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya,” that had killed four "
"","America citizens, including U.S. Ambassador John Christopher Stevens. The President added on "
"","September 13, 2012, that “an additional security force arrived in Yemen in response to security "
"","threats there.” He further stated that: “Although these security forces are equipped for combat, "
"",these movements have been undertaken solely for the purpose of protecting American citizens and 
"","property.” These security forces will remain in Libya and in Yemen, he noted, “until the security "
"",situation becomes such that they are no longer needed.”  
"","Southern Philippines Humanitarian Assistance for Typhoon Bopha. On December 17, 2012, U.S. Pacific "
